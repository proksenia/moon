## **Google Docs**

**Google Docs** is a free app by Google. This app is an analog of the world-famous Microsoft Word. A huge advantage of Google Docs is that all work with text happens in your web browser. Create and edit documents, share your documents with other people, add comments, and people see them immediately. All you need is the Internet.

**All changes are automatically saved during operation**. Moreover, thanks to the history of changes, you can see a list of previous versions of the document, sorted by date and author of changes.
